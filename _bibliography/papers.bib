  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) with high energy density have gained significant popularity in smart grids and portable electronics. LiMn1-xFexPO4 (LMFP) is considered a leading candidate for the cathode, with the potential to combine the low cost of LiFePO4 (LFP) with the high theoretical energy density of LiMnPO4 (LMP). However, quantitative investigation of the intricate coupling between the Fe/Mn ratio and the resulting energy density is challenging due to the parametric complexity. It is crucial to develop a universal approach for the rapid construction of multi-parameter mapping. In this work, we propose an active learning-guided high-throughput workflow for quantitatively predicting the Fe/Mn ratio and the energy density mapping of LMFP. An optimal composition (LiMn0.66Fe0.34PO4) was effectively screened from 81 cathode materials via only 5 samples. Model-guided electrochemical analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between the Fe/Mn ratio and electrochemical properties, including ion mobility and impedance, elucidating the quantitative chemical composition-energy density map of LMFP. The results demonstrated the efficacy of the method in high-throughput screening of LiBs cathode materials.},
