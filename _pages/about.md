I am a final-year undergraduate in Materials Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, studying in the International Honor Class of [School of Materials Science and Engineering](https://en.smse.sjtu.edu.cn/).

I am working on a project about high-throughput screening of combinatorial O-PCMs in the group of [Prof. Hong Wang](https://zias.sjtu.edu.cn/info/1268/1410.htm) at SJTU. I am also involved in the simulation and modeling of materials by doing another project about GNN accelerated phase-field simulation of grain growth under the supervision of [Prof. Hong Liu](https://smse.sjtu.edu.cn/people/detail/39) at SJTU. Besides, I completed projects about solid-electrolyte of lithium-ion batteries, supervised by [Prof. Huanan Duan](https://en.smse.sjtu.edu.cn/people_detail/195), and a DQN flight model. Please check my [projects page](https://JedimasterLu.github.io/projects/) for more details.

I am currently looking for a PhD position in materials science and engineering. My research interests mainly lie in combining machine learning and computational approaches with data-based experiments to investigate phenomena in functional materials and design materials with optimal properties. 

If my research fits what you're looking for, please feel free to [contact me](lujunyuan@sjtu.edu.cn). I'd be glad to hear from you!
