## Introduction

In this project, I am working as a research assistant in [Prof. Hong Liu](https://smse.sjtu.edu.cn/people/detail/39)'s group at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The project is based on a GNN accelerated phase-field method proposed in the paper [Physics-embedded graph network for accelerating phase-field  simulation of microstructure evolution in additive  manufacturing](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-022-00890-9). The project aims to increase the accuracy of existing models and implant sharp interfaces into the approach.

The page is under construction. The details of methods and results will be updated soon.
