## Introduction

In this project, a symmetric Hebb-Wagner method was presented to address the challenge of accurately measuring the electron conductivity of LLZTO, a promising solid electrolyte for solid-state lithium-ion batteries. This project was conducted in collaboration with a senior doctorial student [Guoyao Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li-Guoyao), supervised by Prof. [Huanan Duan](https://en.smse.sjtu.edu.cn/people_detail/195) of [School of Materials Science and Engineering](https://en.smse.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

This was a [PRP project](https://uitp.sjtu.edu.cn/innovation/index.html) (an undergraduate research project) of the school. The method was based on the graduation thesis of Guoyao. My contribution included the preparation of LLZTO pellets, structural and electrochemical characterization, data analysis, writing, and a final thesis defense.

However, the project was not completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. No paper is published for this work since the lack of data. And the project was not continued after a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202204098) almost identical to our work was published.

    The LLZTO samples were prepared by powder sintering. After sintering, both sides of the samples were coated with a thin layer of silver, which acted as blocking electrodes that impede the movement of ions.

The samples were then tested in a electrochemical workstation Solartron 1960. CA curves and EIS curves were measured. Besides, XRD (Japan Rigaku 0.05° min-1，10-70°) and SEM were used (USA Sirion) to characterize the structure and surface morphology of the samples. The Archimedes method was used to measure the density of the samples. The ion conductivity and electron conductivity of samples were calculated based on the equations below: 
$$
\sigma = \frac{L}{R \cdot S} = \frac{4 I L}{\pi E_i d^2}
$$

## Results

The XRD and SEM results showed that the samples were successfully prepared. The relative density of samples are measured to be around 90% and showed good consistency.

## Conclusion
