## Introduction

In this project, a symmetric Hebb-Wagner method was presented to address the challenge of accurately measuring the electron conductivity of LLZTO, a promising solid electrolyte for solid-state lithium-ion batteries. This project was conducted in collaboration with a senior doctorial student [Guoyao Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li-Guoyao), supervised by Prof. [Huanan Duan](https://en.smse.sjtu.edu.cn/people_detail/195) of [School of Materials Science and Engineering](https://en.smse.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

This was a [PRP project](https://uitp.sjtu.edu.cn/innovation/index.html) (an undergraduate research project) of the school. The method was based on the graduation thesis of Guoyao. My contribution included the preparation of LLZTO pellets, structural and electrochemical characterization, data analysis, writing, and a final thesis defense.

However, the project was not completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. No paper is published for this work since the lack of data. And the project was not continued after a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202204098) almost identical to our work was published.
