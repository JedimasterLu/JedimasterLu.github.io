## Introduction

In this project, the composition-parameter-structure-property relations of combinatorial super-latticelike thin films of GeSbSn(Se) and GeSbSeTe were systematically investigated using ion beam deposition and several high-throughput characterization methods.

The project was conducted with Hongjian Yuan, a doctorial student, and Yuxuan Li, an undergraduate, under the supervision of Prof. [Hong Wang](https://smse.sjtu.edu.cn/people/detail/274) and Prof. [Jian Hui](https://smse.sjtu.edu.cn/people/detail/392). We have applied a project funded by [Zhiyuan Innovative Research Center](https://zirc.sjtu.edu.cn/Zirc/index) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
