## Introduction

In this project, the composition-parameter-structure-property relations of combinatorial super-latticelike thin films of GeSbSn(Se) and GeSbSeTe were systematically contructed using ion beam deposition and several high-throughput characterization methods.

The project was conducted with Hongjian Yuan, a doctorial student, and Yuxuan Li, an undergraduate, under the supervision of Prof. [Hong Wang](https://smse.sjtu.edu.cn/people/detail/274) and Prof. [Jian Hui](https://smse.sjtu.edu.cn/people/detail/392). We have applied a project funded by [Zhiyuan Innovative Research Center](https://zirc.sjtu.edu.cn/Zirc/index) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

## Methods

### Synthesis of combinatorial thin films

A ion beam deposition (IBD) system in the lab is used to synthesize combinatorial thin films. The composition of thin films is changing across the substrate, which is controlled by the deposition rate and a moving mask of each element. Then, after characterization of as-deposited states, the thin films are heat treated in vacuum tube furnace at different temperatures to form crystalline structures.

The paper of this work has already been submitted. The details of methods and results will be updated after the paper is published.
